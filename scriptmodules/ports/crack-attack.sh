rp_module_help="Because this uses X, you may find that you are unable to control the game and the game appears in a small window in the top left. Use the Runcommand option to set the resolution to CEA-4 or similarly smaller sizes. This will allow you to control the game as the window will have focus and also fill up more of the screen."
